# Spoken Digits Image data and Addendum for ICML 2019 time series workshop submission

The [Free Spoken Digit Dataset](https://github.com/Jakobovski/ free-spoken-digit-dataset) consists of 4 individuals speaking the digits 0 through 9 50 times each for a total size of 2000 wave files.  We took each segment, normalized it zero-mean, unit-variance, clipped it for white space and then converted the resulting arrays into 2-D images.  This data can be thought of as ”spoken MNIST” in image form.

The Data Repo can be viewed at the following [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m2h_vaApQZI6xDPLWw6rPJ9TEW8tV72-r9-bwWz9vdM/edit?usp=sharing) and downloaded from the following [tarfile](http://www.diegoolano.com/files/spokev3cropped.tar.gz) (38 MB file)

Additional images referred to in the ICML 2019 Time Series workshop may be found in the [arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08935) which focuses solely on the medical time series data.  In particular Figure 1 shows MNIST prototypes, while Figure 5 and 6 and Tables 1 and 2 refer to NICU related accuracy plots, confusion matrices, and hyper parameter experimental results.
